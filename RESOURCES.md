# Resources
A mix if useful book, articles and videos on the overall training topics.

## Practice

In order to become fluent with the techniques seen during the training you have to practice - a lot - in the end you know: **practice make perfects**.

You can use this repository to train in the various rafactoring done together or new ones. In particular, the repository offers a series of numbered branches (trivia-XX-theme) that mark key moments/targets. You can use them for even more targeted practice.

Repeating all the steps taken during the course, commit after commit, can also help you reinforce your learning.
