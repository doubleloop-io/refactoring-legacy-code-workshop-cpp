- not used main and GameRunnr::run args

- swtich statments ask queston and current category
- primitive obsession for questions x category
- data clumps for all questions fields

- current_category could be static
- Game::currentCategory could be inlined????
- possible feature envy between Game::askQuestion and Game::currentCategory

# void fill_questions();
# void ask_question(std::string current_category);
